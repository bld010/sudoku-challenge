## My Process

// My Process:

// I saw that we need to group and check each horizontal row
// This meant grouping every 3 3-number blocks into one row
// and checking against a valid row (an array of 1-9)

// Similarly, we needed to group every column
// I noticed that I can take the first index of each row
// that was already sorted and put that into an array of 
// all the first elements in each row, then second, then third.
// Each box of 9 numbers (3x3) needs to be checked (I ran out of time here)
